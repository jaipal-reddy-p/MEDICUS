                <p>price:44.63 Ciproxin is a brand name for a medication called ciprofloxacin, which is an antibiotic belonging to the fluoroquinolone class. It is commonly used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections, including respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, gastrointestinal infections, and certain sexually transmitted diseases.Ciproxin works by inhibiting the activity of bacterial enzymes called DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are involved in the replication and repair of bacterial DNA. By interfering with these enzymes, ciprofloxacin prevents bacteria from multiplying and spreading, thereby helping to eliminate the infection.
