                    <p>Lipitor is a brand name for the medication atorvastatin, which belongs to a class of drugs known as statins. It is primarily prescribed to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke.

                        Atorvastatin works by inhibiting an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a crucial role in the production of cholesterol in the body. By blocking this enzyme, Lipitor helps lower the levels of LDL cholesterol (often referred to as "bad" cholesterol) and triglycerides in the blood, while also increasing levels of HDL cholesterol (often referred to as "good" cholesterol).
