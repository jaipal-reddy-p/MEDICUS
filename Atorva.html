                    <p>Atorva tablet is a prescription medication that contains atorvastatin as its active ingredient. It belongs to a group of drugs known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or "statins," which are used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood.

                        The tablet is typically oval or oblong in shape, and it is available in strengths of 10mg, 20mg, 40mg, and 80mg. The tablet is usually taken orally, with or without food, and the dosage and frequency of use will depend on the individual's medical condition, age, and response to treatment.
                        
                        Atorvastatin works by blocking the enzyme responsible for the production of cholesterol in the liver, which can help to reduce the levels of LDL or "bad" cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. It can also help to raise the levels of HDL or "good" cholesterol.
