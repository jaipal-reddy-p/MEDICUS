                <p>1500rs, Glucosamine is a naturally occurring compound found in the fluid surrounding joints. It is commonly used as a dietary supplement for its potential benefits in managing joint health, particularly in conditions such as osteoarthritis.
                   Glucosamine is primarily produced in the body from glucose and is a building block for the synthesis of certain substances involved in the formation and repair of cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and other connective tissues. It is believed to support joint function and may have anti-inflammatory effects.
