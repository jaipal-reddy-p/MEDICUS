                <p>Avil 25 tablet is a brand name for an antihistamine medication called pheniramine maleate. Each tablet contains 25mg of pheniramine maleate as the active ingredient.

                    Pheniramine maleate is used to treat various allergic conditions such as hay fever, hives, itching, and allergic rhinitis. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction that causes symptoms such as itching, swelling, and redness.
                    
                    Avil 25 tablet is commonly prescribed for adults and children over 12 years old. The usual recommended dosage is one tablet orally every 4-6 hours as needed for relief of symptoms.
