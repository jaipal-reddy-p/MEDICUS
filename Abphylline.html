                    <p>AB Phylline capsule is a medication that contains theophylline as its active ingredient. It is a bronchodilator medication that is used to treat respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchitis.

                        The capsule is typically available in strengths of 100mg or 200mg, and it is usually taken orally, with or without food. The dosage and frequency of use will depend on the individual's medical condition, age, and response to treatment.
                        
                        Theophylline works by relaxing the muscles in the airways, which can help to improve breathing and reduce the frequency and severity of asthma attacks or COPD exacerbations. It can also help to improve lung function and exercise tolerance in people with these conditions.
