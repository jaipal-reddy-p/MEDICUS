                    <p>Fexofenadine is an antihistamine medication that is commonly sold under the brand name Allegra. It is used to relieve symptoms associated with allergic conditions such as seasonal allergies (hay fever) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (chronic hives) in adults and children.

                        Here are some key points to know about fexofenadine:
                        
                        Allergy relief: Fexofenadine is primarily used to treat symptoms caused by allergic reactions, including sneezing, runny nose, itchy or watery eyes, and itching of the nose or throat. It provides relief from these symptoms by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released during allergic reactions.
                        
                        Non-sedating: Fexofenadine is classified as a second-generation antihistamine, which means it is less likely to cause sedation compared to older antihistamines. This makes it a preferred choice for individuals who want to avoid the drowsiness associated with some other antihistamine medications.
